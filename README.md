# coding_challenge-46 | Build a website with ChatGPT


We have an exciting challenge for you: Using ChatGPT, build a website! As always this coding challenge is for anyone to join at whatever the level. We even provide the starter/demo code so you can use it as a reference. Your challenge is to get creative and build a website from scracth using ChatGPT as an assistant! Here are the resources I recommend to stay on top of this fast evolving tool:

Guides: 
1. Watch the [ChatGPT 4 launch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ).
2. Learn how [ChatGPT works](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/chatgpt-explained-a-guide-for-normies).
3. Watch [this ZTM course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/large-language-models/)
4. Build your own [ChatGPT with this](https://cocktailpeanut.github.io/dalai/#/?id=dalai) or [with this](https://xenova.github.io/transformers.js/).
5. Play around: ChatGPT + Code Interpreter = [Magic](https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2023/03/23/chatgpt-code-interpreter-magic/)

## Submissions
Student submissions will be posted here at the end of the challenge!

## The Rules:

1. You will need to follow the instructions/tutorial above to build your project.

2. **You have until April 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...). Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 


## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all of our challenges, there is zero benefit or monetary gain we receive from it. This is just our way of extending the classroom and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of the courses. If you are so kind, please leave a review of ZTM somewhere on the internet and let others know about us... it really helps out :)**
